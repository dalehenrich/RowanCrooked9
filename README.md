# RowanCrooked9 - spec_0003
Test case for GemTalk/Rowan#820.

The file extensions.gs contains a new class (RowanSample9Class2) and extension methods for the classes found in [RowanSample9:spec_0082](https://github.com/dalehenrich/RowanSample9/tree/spec_0082).

In a set of tests, projects will be created using RowanHybrid, Monticello and Rowan package conventions and topaz package format packges will be generated for each of the projects and the the projects will be loaded into the image after spec_0082 has been loaded.

The generated packages should change the method and class categories to conform to the package convention.
